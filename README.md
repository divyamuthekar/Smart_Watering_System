Smart_Watering_system.
Design and develop an innovative smart irrigation system utilizing IoT technology to efficiently manage and automate the irrigation process for plants or crops. 
The system should incorporate sensors to measure soil moisture levels, weather conditions,water level and plant-specific requirements.
Using this data, create a user-friendly interface that allows remote monitoring and control of the irrigation system through a web platform.
The objective is to optimize water usage, prevent overwatering or underwatering, conserve resources, and enhance plant health while providing real-time updates and alerts to users regarding the status of the system and the environmental conditions affecting plant growth.
